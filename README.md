# Anomalies-Detection-in-Apache-access-log

#Project Overview
This project involves developing a Spark application to analyze Apache Access logs and detect anomalies in API logs. The application will extract and analyze information from semi-structured parquet logs to identify trends and anomalies based on response codes, traffic, frequent visitors, top endpoints, and content size statistics. The ultimate goal is to detect unusual patterns and potential issues within the API logs.
